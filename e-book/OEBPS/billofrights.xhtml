	<h1 class="heading">United States Bill of Rights</h1>

	<p class="noindent-quote"><i>In the United States, the <b>Bill of Rights</b> is the term for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. These amendments explicitly limit the Federal government's powers, protecting the rights of the people by preventing Congress from abridging freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of religious worship, and the right to bear arms, preventing unreasonable search and seizure, cruel and unusual punishment, and self-incrimination, and guaranteeing due process of law and a speedy public trial with an impartial jury. In addition, the <b>Bill of Rights</b> states that "the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people," and reserves all powers not specifically granted to the Federal government to the citizenry or States. These amendments came into effect on December 15, 1791, when ratified by three-fourths of the States.</i></p>

	<p class="noindent-quote top">The <b>Bill of Rights</b> is the third of the three Charters of Freedom along with the <a href="declaration.xhtml">Declaration of Independence</a> and the <a href="constitution.xhtml">Constitution</a>.</p>
